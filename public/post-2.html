        Several weeks ago, I completely redesigned, rewrote, and re-engineered the Pierre Docs. What originally started
        as a few Notion pages had already turned into a set of low-key static pages on our logged out site, but after a
        slew of awesome product updates, our very manual setup was severely lacking and we simply needed more docs.

        The last goal for me was to be able to abstract all of this so I can use it elsewhere—like on the Changelog or
        in the Styleguide I’ve been (very) slowly chipping away at. I’ll save that for another post as I’m still working
        on that part.

        See you again for the next part!
