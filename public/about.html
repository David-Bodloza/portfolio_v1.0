        In 2008, he became a Product and Platform Designer at Twitter working on Promoted Tweets, Twitter.com during

        While at Twitter, he also created the popular open source front-end toolkit Bootstrap with @fat. In late 2012,
        he left to join GitHub as a Product Designer.

        At GitHub, he worked on GitHub Enterprise, redesigned Issues, redesigned conversations, designed split diffs,
