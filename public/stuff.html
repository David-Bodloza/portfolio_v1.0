    <h2> Stuff</h2>
    <p>
        Inspired by internet friends, here's a collection of things I use on a daily basis, from software to hardware,
        for work and for fun.
    </p>
    <h3>The Desk</h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.dellonline.co.za/products/dell-g15-5530-15-6-inch-core-i7-13650hx-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-rtx-4050-win-11-home-gaming-laptop-191370?utm_source=www.dellonline.co.za&utm_medium=sf&utm_campaign=googleads&variant=45707555602680&sfdr_ptcid=43786_617_707846498&sfdr_hash=6eed05ca91ad1c28ac02bb8d5083150a&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA74G9BhAEEiwA8kNfpal2JVOaA3DzLy1EtAWurUcUR-_qo-cn0_fAwxxIfKKofGzvEpOI-hoC3DIQAvD_BwE">Dell
        G15 5530 15.6-inch Core i7
    </a>
    <p>
        Love the speed, display, and the Space Black color. A no-brainer.
    </p>
    <a href="#">The 15inch Monitor display</a>
    <p>
        Love the look, and while the XDR is surely even better, I can't justify the price. Just get the Studio Display.
        Higher refresh rate would be nice, though.
    </p>
    <a href="#">The magic keyboard</a>
    <p>
        If only it came in black. I've had so many keyboards, but having TouchID built in is now a must.
    </p>
    <a href="#">The magic mouse</a>
    <p>
        I've been using a Logitech MX mouse for awhile, but came back to this recently for the momentum scrolling. It's
        also just too pretty, and the charging port on the bottom is fun.
    </p>
    <a href="#">Solid plastic Standing Desk</a>
    <p>
        I love this desk. It's 1.75" thick walnut and feels buttery smooth. Sit-stand is a must these days to keep your
        body somewhat healthy.
    </p>
    <a href="#">Laptop and Mouse mat</a>
    <p>
        Comfy and looks great, keyboard and mouse fit nicely on it. Also doubles as a coaster if you get the larger size
    </p>

    <h3>Hardware</h3>
    <a href="#">Samsung Galaxy</a>
    <p>
        It's a Samsung, and it's the good one personally(1TB in Desert Rose). Honestly, it's too big—especially with the
        new camera control button that I accidentally hit all the time while taking photos. Next time, I plan on the
        normal Pro.
    </p>
    <h4>Normal Watch Series 10 in Red</h4>
    <p>
        Not much to say here—love the black and red look of this finish.
    </p>
    <h4>Notebook</h4>
    <p>
        While sometimes I write or sketch on the iPad, it's pretty much exclusively for watching TV and movies. I went
        with the 12.9" because I wanted the largest screen possible.
    </p>
    <a href="#">Volcano headphones</a>
    <p>
        My everday carry headphones. Just great all around obviously. New noise canceling is a nice touch.
    </p>
    <a href="#">Dual USB-C Power Adapter</a>
    <p>
        Stop carrying around multiple adapters. This one is all you need for a MacBook, iPhone, and Apple Watch. Super
        clutch, especially for travel. I prefer this one over the Compact version because it works with the World Travel
        Adapter Kit and extension cable.
    </p>
    <h3>Software</h3>
    <a href="#">Visual Studio Code</a>
    <p>
        My go-to code editor for just about everything, though I really miss the simplicity of Atom.
    </p>
    <a href="#">Screen Shooter</a>
    <p>
        In a matter of seconds highlight important parts of your screenshot with our annotation tool.
    </p>
    <a href="#">Every Things</a>
    <p>
        Cultured Code nailed the todo list app years ago.
    </p>
    <a href="#">Spotify</a>
    <p>
        It's great, but I'll always tell you I miss Rdio.
